# Realtime Audio Architecture

## Design Goal

TX-5DR keeps digital decoding audio and realtime radio monitoring explicit and separate. Radio monitoring uses native input frames in both voice and digital modes; the digital 12 kHz ring buffer is internal to decode/spectrum work.

## Digital 12 kHz Chain

The digital chain is centered on the existing 12 kHz ring buffer. It serves FT8/FT4 decode and spectrum work only.

- Soundcard input may be resampled into the digital 12 kHz format.
- ICOM WLAN input is already 12 kHz and can be written directly to the digital path.
- This path is not used for radio realtime listening in either voice or digital mode.
- OpenWebRX preview remains a buffered preview use case and is not part of the native radio bypass.

## Native Radio Bypass Chain

The radio bypass exists to avoid hidden latency from the digital ring buffer.

- Soundcard radio input emits `nativeAudioInputData` before digital resampling.
- ICOM WLAN emits native 12 kHz frames without extra conversion.
- `NativeRadioRxSource` subscribes to native input frames and TX monitor frames.
- `RealtimeRxAudioRouter` chooses `NativeRadioRxSource` for every `scope === 'radio'` session.
- OpenWebRX preview continues to use `BufferedPreviewRxSource` backed by `BufferedPreviewAudioService`.

## Transport Edge Chain

Transport publishers are edge components. They do not decide which audio source is correct.

- `rtc-data-audio` sends codec-aware audio frames over unordered/unreliable WebRTC DataChannel.
- `rtc-data-audio` signaling is same-origin WebSocket `/api/realtime/rtc-data-audio`; media uses the fixed UDP port configured by `RTC_DATA_AUDIO_UDP_PORT` (default `50110`) with ICE UDP mux.
- For FRP or static NAT, admins may set an external rtc-data-audio public host/IP and UDP port. The server appends those as extra outgoing ICE host candidates and keeps the original local candidates, so LAN/direct clients still work.
- `ws-compat` sends the same codec-aware frame stream over WebSocket and relies on stale-frame dropping to avoid latency buildup.
- Both transports share the browser AudioContext/AudioWorklet runtime during fallback; only the network transport is replaced.
- Codec preference is negotiated per session: `auto` defaults to Opus when both browser WebCodecs and server audify Opus backend are available; otherwise the selected transport uses PCM s16le.
- Opus runs over both transports. Codec failure falls back to PCM on the same transport; only RTC ICE/DataChannel failure falls back to `ws-compat`.

Opus is the default low-bandwidth codec path:

- Soundcard 48 kHz radio frames are encoded as Opus 48 kHz without the PCM decimator.
- ICOM WLAN 12 kHz frames are encoded as Opus 12 kHz when the browser advertises 12 kHz decode support; otherwise the server uses a low-latency streaming resampler to the negotiated supported Opus rate, usually 48 kHz.
- 24 kHz and 16 kHz native inputs are encoded at their source rate.
- Non-standard source rates are normalized by a streaming resampler to the nearest supported Opus rate (`48k/24k/16k/12k/8k`).
- Opus uses 20 ms frames. Expected software latency overhead is roughly `+18-30 ms`, mainly packetization plus encode/decode scheduling, in exchange for reducing typical realtime mono bitrate from hundreds of kbps PCM to about `24-32 kbps`.

PCM fallback remains intentionally simple and compatible. High-rate native PCM is reduced only at this transport edge. The source remains native, but publishers can apply a direct integer decimator for common high-rate inputs:

- 48 kHz soundcard radio frames are sent as 24 kHz PCM by keeping every other sample.
- 96 kHz sources are sent as 24 kHz PCM by keeping every fourth sample.
- 24 kHz, 16 kHz, and 12 kHz sources are sent unchanged.
- 12 kHz ICOM WLAN frames and 16 kHz buffered preview frames are sent unchanged.
- The decimator keeps phase across chunks, so non-divisible device buffer sizes do not accumulate drift; the frame `sampleRate` metadata always reflects the transport sample rate.
- Unusual high input rates still use the smallest integer factor that keeps the transport rate near or below 24 kHz, instead of falling back to full-rate PCM.
- This intentionally removes the previous transport-edge low-pass FIR to test whether 24 kHz direct integer decimation is acceptable in practice with less processing and less tonal coloration.

## FRP Public UDP Candidate Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser as External browser
  participant Web as HTTPS/TCP site or FRP web entry
  participant Server as TX-5DR signaling
  participant UDP as FRP UDP mapping
  participant RTC as node-datachannel UDP 50110

  Browser->>Web: WebSocket /api/realtime/rtc-data-audio
  Web->>Server: signaling token and SDP
  Server-->>Browser: SDP offer with local candidates
  Server-->>Browser: extra public candidate publicHost:publicUdpPort
  Browser->>UDP: ICE checks to public UDP endpoint
  UDP->>RTC: forwarded UDP packets
  Browser-->>Server: DataChannel opens, negotiated codec frames start
  Browser-->>Web: fallback to /api/realtime/ws-compat if ICE/DataChannel fails
```

The public UDP setting is deliberately append-only. A bad FRP endpoint should not break local candidates, and session startup still has `ws-compat` as the guaranteed fallback.

## Voice Keyer TX Monitor

Voice keyer monitoring is part of the voice source layer, not a transport-specific shortcut.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser as Browser mic
  participant Transport as Current transport
  participant Server as VoiceSessionManager
  participant Radio as Radio output
  participant Source as NativeRadioRxSource
  participant Router as RealtimeRxAudioRouter
  participant Listener as Browser listener

  Browser->>Transport: Opus or PCM frames while PTT active
  Transport->>Server: handleParticipantAudioFrame
  Server->>Radio: write TX audio
  Server-->>Source: txMonitorAudioData
  Source-->>Source: suppress native RX during TX monitor hold
  Source->>Router: voice-tx-monitor frame
  Router->>Transport: current RX publisher
  Transport->>Listener: monitor audio
```

The invariant is that TX monitor audio follows the same RX publisher path as normal radio listening. This keeps `rtc-data-audio` and `ws-compat` behavior consistent and prevents transport-specific hidden monitor paths.

## Voice TX Uplink

Manual microphone PTT uses the same public transports as monitoring, but the TX path has its own realtime queue policy.

- Browser capture emits 16 kHz mono 20 ms frames.
- `VoiceTxUplinkSender` is the single browser-side sender for `rtc-data-audio` and `ws-compat`; it gates on PTT, encodes Opus when negotiated, assigns sequence numbers, applies clock-sync timestamps when reliable, and drops frames when transport backlog exceeds the realtime budget.
- Server transport handlers decode Opus/PCM frames through the same codec pipeline and pass decoded samples to `VoiceSessionManager`; they do not own output buffering policy.
- `VoiceTxOutputPipeline` owns server-side jitter buffering, streaming linear resampling to the selected TX device rate, stale-frame dropping, short tail-PLC/silence recovery, and output write diagnostics.
- TX diagnostics keep strict end-to-end timing separate from server-only timing: `endToEndMs` is recorded only when browser/server clock sync is reliable, while `serverPipelineMs` covers server receive to output write for fallback troubleshooting.
- PTT startup disables output playout until radio PTT is active; only a small startup buffer is retained, and old frames are trimmed rather than flushed late.

## Latency Policy

Realtime voice audio is a state stream, not a file stream.

- Prefer dropping late frames over playing stale audio.
- Keep publisher queues bounded in milliseconds.
- Use frame timestamps and sequence numbers for recovery and diagnostics.
- Do not re-enter large playback prefill after underrun; use at most one short PLC tail, then silence briefly and resume with fresh frames.
- Keep sample-rate conversion only at true transport/device edges.
- During transport fallback, keep the browser AudioContext and AudioWorklet runtime alive; only replace the network transport. This avoids autoplay/microphone gesture regressions and prevents duplicate audio services.
