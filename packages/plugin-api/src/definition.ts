/**
 * Describes a TX-5DR plugin module.
 *
 * The default export of a plugin package or entry file must satisfy this
 * interface. It combines declarative metadata, optional UI descriptors and the
 * runtime callbacks that the host invokes after the plugin is loaded.
 *
 * A plugin can be one of two categories:
 * - `strategy`: owns the operator automation state machine and is mutually
 *   exclusive per operator.
 * - `utility`: augments the pipeline or UI and can run alongside other utility
 *   plugins.
 *
 * The TX-5DR host reads this definition once during load, validates the static
 * fields and then wires the lifecycle callbacks and hooks into the plugin
 * subsystem.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * /** @type {import('@tx5dr/plugin-api').PluginDefinition} *\/
 * export default {
 *   name: 'my-plugin',
 *   version: '1.0.0',
 *   type: 'utility',
 *   description: 'Annotates interesting decoded stations.',
 *   hooks: {
 *     onDecode(messages, ctx) {
 *       ctx.log.info('decoded', { count: messages.length });
 *     },
 *   },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { PluginDefinition } from '@tx5dr/plugin-api';
 *
 * const plugin: PluginDefinition = {
 *   name: 'my-strategy',
 *   version: '1.0.0',
 *   type: 'strategy',
 *   createStrategyRuntime(ctx) {
 *     return {
 *       decide() {
 *         return { stop: false };
 *       },
 *       getTransmitText() {
 *         return null;
 *       },
 *       requestCall() {},
 *       getSnapshot() {
 *         return { currentState: 'idle' };
 *       },
 *       patchContext() {},
 *       setState() {},
 *       setSlotContent() {},
 *       reset() {},
 *     };
 *   },
 * };
 *
 * export default plugin;
 * ```
